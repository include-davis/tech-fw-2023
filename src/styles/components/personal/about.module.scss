// We try to stick to font sizes in rem units for scalability, responsive design and consistency as we discussed in the workshop. 
// also, most of your elements do not have any spacing around them. If you're still working on it, you can consider trying out and adding other styles we've discussed in the workshops.
// especially try out flex box for easily arranging your elements as that is something you'll be using very frequently. (You might have to change your HTML structure a little. Think back to the box structure.)
