// this looks good but I would recommend you to try out other properties we've discussed and see which ones you want to keep for your page. Doing it right now will get you used to the different properties that you can use for your elements. 
// also, your page isnt responsive right now, so incorporate media queries. I will check back in a week for that. Let me know if you need any help.
