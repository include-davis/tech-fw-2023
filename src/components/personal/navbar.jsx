// I am a huge fan of how you laid everything out, really good work! The only thing I wanted to point out is to move the styling for your image div into the CSS file. Some elements might require in-line but when possible, we want external CSS Also, if you go with my suggestion (in CSS file) to move the image to the right side, you can remove the personalImage div altogether. Other than that, you have good classNames and good format :)
export default function Navbar() {
